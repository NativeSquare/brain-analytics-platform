# Story 6.2: Contract Security & Access Control

Status: done

> **PROJECT SCOPE:** All frontend work targets the client-facing web app at `apps/web/`. Do NOT modify `apps/admin/` — that is a separate internal admin panel. All UI components, pages, layouts, and routes go in `apps/web/`.

## Story

As an admin,
I want contract data to be completely hidden from non-admin users (except a player viewing their own contract),
so that sensitive financial information is protected at every layer of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

### AC1: Contract Tab Hidden for Non-Admin Users
**Given** a user with a non-admin role (Coach, Analyst, Physio, Player, Staff)
**When** they view any player's profile page
**Then** the "Contract" tab is not visible in the tab navigation
**And** no contract-related UI elements are rendered

### AC2: Convex Query-Layer Enforcement for Non-Admin Users
**Given** a user with a non-admin role
**When** any Convex contract query is executed (getContract, getContractDownloadUrl)
**Then** the query returns `null` (not an error) for non-admin, non-self requests
**And** no contract fields, PDF URLs, or extraction data are included in the response
**And** enforcement happens inside the Convex function, not via UI-only guards

### AC3: Direct URL Access Denied
**Given** a non-admin user who manually navigates to a player profile URL and attempts to access contract data
**When** the player profile page loads with a "contract" tab parameter or hash
**Then** the Contract tab does not render
**And** no contract data is fetched or exposed in the client

### AC4: Player Can View Own Contract (Read-Only)
**Given** a player is viewing their own profile
**When** they navigate to the Contract tab
**Then** the Contract tab is visible for their own profile only
**And** they can see their own extracted contract details (salary, bonuses, clauses, duration, termination terms, governing law)
**And** the original contract PDF is downloadable
**And** all fields are read-only (no "Edit" button rendered)
**And** they cannot upload or replace a contract

### AC5: Player Cannot View Other Players' Contracts
**Given** a player user
**When** they view another player's profile
**Then** the Contract tab is not visible
**And** the Convex query returns `null` for that player's contract

### AC6: Team-Scoped Contract Isolation
**Given** an admin from Team A
**When** they attempt to query a contract belonging to a player in Team B
**Then** the query returns `null` (teamId mismatch)
**And** no cross-tenant contract data is ever accessible

### AC7: Contract Tab Permissions Query
**Given** any authenticated user on a player profile page
**When** the page determines which tabs to display
**Then** a dedicated query (`canViewContract`) returns `true` only if:
  - User has admin role, OR
  - User is a player viewing their own profile (user.playerId matches the profile's playerId)
**And** this query is the single source of truth for Contract tab visibility

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Backend Tasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create `canViewContract` Authorization Query** (AC: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7)
  - [x] 1.1: Add to `packages/backend/convex/contracts/queries.ts`:
    ```
    canViewContract(ctx, { playerId }) → boolean
    ```
    - Call `requireAuth(ctx)` to get `{ user, teamId }`
    - Return `true` if `user.role === "admin"`
    - Return `true` if `user.role === "player"` AND user's linked `playerId === args.playerId`
    - Return `false` for all other cases
    - Always filter by `teamId` — if player not in same team, return `false`
  - [x] 1.2: Ensure the query uses the `players` table to verify the requesting player's identity (lookup user → player record via `userId`)

- [x] **Task 2: Harden `getContract` Query with Player-Self Access** (AC: 2, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] 2.1: Modify `packages/backend/convex/contracts/queries.ts` `getContract`:
    - Current (from Story 6.1): `requireRole(ctx, ["admin"])`
    - New logic: call `requireAuth(ctx)`, then check:
      - If admin → proceed (full access)
      - If player AND `playerId` matches own linked player → proceed (read-only flag returned)
      - Otherwise → return `null` (no error thrown, no data leaked)
    - Always scope by `teamId`
  - [x] 2.2: Add a `readOnly: boolean` field to the query return type:
    - `true` for player viewing own contract
    - `false` for admin
  - [x] 2.3: Ensure `getContractDownloadUrl` follows same authorization logic — admin OR player-self only

- [x] **Task 3: Harden Contract Mutations (Admin-Only Write Access)** (AC: 4)
  - [x] 3.1: Verify `uploadContract` mutation uses `requireRole(ctx, ["admin"])` — players cannot upload
  - [x] 3.2: Verify `updateContractFields` mutation uses `requireRole(ctx, ["admin"])` — players cannot edit
  - [x] 3.3: Add explicit `NOT_AUTHORIZED` ConvexError if non-admin attempts mutation

- [x] **Task 4: Write Security-Focused Backend Tests** (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] 4.1: Add tests to `packages/backend/convex/contracts/__tests__/security.test.ts`
  - [x] 4.2: Test `canViewContract`:
    - Admin user → returns `true` for any player in same team
    - Player user viewing own profile → returns `true`
    - Player user viewing other player → returns `false`
    - Coach/Analyst/Physio/Staff → returns `false`
    - Admin from different team → returns `false`
  - [x] 4.3: Test `getContract` hardened access:
    - Admin → returns full contract with `readOnly: false`
    - Player-self → returns contract with `readOnly: true`
    - Player-other → returns `null`
    - Non-admin role (Coach, Physio, etc.) → returns `null`
    - Wrong team admin → returns `null`
  - [x] 4.4: Test `getContractDownloadUrl` access:
    - Admin → returns signed URL
    - Player-self → returns signed URL
    - Non-admin/non-self → returns `null`
  - [x] 4.5: Test mutation guards:
    - `uploadContract` rejects non-admin (including players)
    - `updateContractFields` rejects non-admin (including players)

### Frontend Tasks

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Contract Tab Conditional Rendering** (AC: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7)
  - [x] 5.1: In `apps/web/src/app/(app)/players/[playerId]/page.tsx`:
    - Subscribe to `api.contracts.queries.canViewContract` via `useQuery` passing the current `playerId`
    - Only include the "Contract" tab in the tabs array when `canViewContract` returns `true`
    - Do NOT render a hidden/disabled tab — completely omit it from the DOM
  - [x] 5.2: If `canViewContract` is still loading (`undefined`), do not flash the tab — wait for resolution before rendering tabs

- [x] **Task 6: Update ContractCard for Read-Only Mode** (AC: 4)
  - [x] 6.1: In `apps/web/src/components/players/ContractCard.tsx`:
    - Read the `readOnly` flag from the `getContract` query response
    - When `readOnly === true`:
      - Hide the "Upload Contract" button
      - Hide the "Edit" button on extracted fields
      - Hide the "Replace Contract" confirmation
      - Display all fields as static text (no form controls)
    - When `readOnly === false` (admin):
      - Show full edit/upload/replace functionality (existing Story 6.1 behavior)
  - [x] 6.2: Ensure the "Download PDF" button remains visible in both admin and player-self modes

- [x] **Task 7: Verify No Contract Data Leakage in Player Profile** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] 7.1: Confirm that the player profile page does NOT pre-fetch contract data for all users — only fetch when `canViewContract` is `true`
  - [x] 7.2: Ensure no contract fields appear in the player profile overview/header area (contract data only in Contract tab)
  - [x] 7.3: Verify the browser network tab shows no contract-related Convex queries for non-authorized users

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

- **Auth Enforcement at Query Layer (NOT UI-Only)**:
  Every contract query and mutation MUST call `requireAuth(ctx)` or `requireRole(ctx, ["admin"])` before accessing data. The UI conditional rendering is a UX enhancement, NOT a security mechanism. The Convex layer is the single source of truth.
  [Source: architecture.md#Authentication & Security]

- **Authorization Helpers** (`packages/backend/convex/lib/auth.ts`):
  ```typescript
  requireAuth(ctx)                        // returns { user, teamId } or throws
  requireRole(ctx, ["admin"])             // returns { user, teamId } or throws
  requireRole(ctx, ["admin", "physio"])   // any of these roles
  requireSelf(ctx, userId)               // user can only access own data
  ```
  These MUST exist from Epic 2. If not yet implemented, this story depends on them.
  [Source: architecture.md#Authentication & Security]

- **Error Pattern — Return null, don't throw for unauthorized reads:**
  For queries where the user simply shouldn't see data (like a coach viewing contracts), return `null` instead of throwing `NOT_AUTHORIZED`. Throwing errors would leak information about data existence. Reserve `ConvexError({ code: "NOT_AUTHORIZED" })` for mutation rejections where the user actively tries a forbidden action.
  [Source: architecture.md#Format Patterns]

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Every query filters by `teamId` from `requireAuth(ctx)`. Cross-tenant contract access is impossible at the data layer.
  [Source: architecture.md#Authentication & Security]

- **Player-to-User Linkage**: The `players` table has a `userId` field that links to the `users` table. To check "is this player me?", query the `players` table for the current `userId` and compare the resulting `playerId` against the requested `playerId`.

### Current Codebase State (from Story 6.1 analysis)

- **User Schema** (`packages/backend/convex/table/users.ts`):
  Current role field: `role: v.optional(v.union(v.literal("user"), v.literal("admin")))`
  Architecture target: `role: "admin" | "coach" | "analyst" | "physio" | "player" | "staff"`
  The role field must be extended before this story can function correctly. This is an Epic 2 dependency.

- **Auth Lib** (`packages/backend/convex/lib/auth/`):
  Currently contains only `ResendOTP.ts` and `ResendOTPPasswordReset.ts` — no `requireAuth`/`requireRole` helpers yet. The architecture specifies these at `packages/backend/convex/lib/auth.ts`. This is an Epic 2 dependency.

- **Contracts Module**: Does not exist yet — created by Story 6.1. This story layers security hardening on top of 6.1's implementation.

### Player Self-Access Pattern

The player-self access check requires:
1. Get current user from auth context → `userId`
2. Query `players` table: find player where `userId === currentUserId` AND `teamId === currentTeamId`
3. If found, compare that player's `_id` with the `playerId` argument
4. If match → this player is viewing their own profile → allow read-only contract access

This pattern should be extracted into a reusable helper if not already available:
```typescript
async function isPlayerSelf(ctx, playerId: Id<"players">): Promise<boolean> {
  const { user, teamId } = await requireAuth(ctx);
  if (user.role !== "player") return false;
  const playerRecord = await ctx.db
    .query("players")
    .withIndex("by_userId_teamId", q => q.eq("userId", user._id).eq("teamId", teamId))
    .first();
  return playerRecord?._id === playerId;
}
```

### NFR Compliance

- **NFR5**: All data access enforced at the Convex mutation/query layer (not UI-only).
- **NFR6**: Multi-tenant isolation — no cross-team contract data access at the data layer.
- **NFR8**: Contract data accessible only to admin users (extended: + player viewing own).
- **NFR9**: Signed URLs for PDF storage — never publicly accessible.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **DO NOT** check permissions only on the UI side — always enforce in Convex queries/mutations.
- **DO NOT** throw errors for unauthorized read queries — return `null` to avoid leaking data existence.
- **DO NOT** hide the Contract tab with CSS `display: none` — completely omit it from the React tree.
- **DO NOT** fetch contract data and then filter it on the client — never fetch it in the first place for unauthorized users.
- **DO NOT** use `any` types — use Convex generated types for contract records.

### Testing Standards

- Backend tests: `@convex-dev/test` + `vitest` co-located at `packages/backend/convex/contracts/__tests__/security.test.ts`
- Test all role permutations: admin, coach, analyst, physio, player (self), player (other), staff
- Test cross-tenant isolation
- Test both query returns (null vs data) and mutation rejections (ConvexError)

### Project Structure Notes

- Backend queries: `packages/backend/convex/contracts/queries.ts` — modify existing file from Story 6.1
- Backend mutations: `packages/backend/convex/contracts/mutations.ts` — verify existing file from Story 6.1
- Backend tests: `packages/backend/convex/contracts/__tests__/security.test.ts` — new file
- Frontend player profile: `apps/web/src/app/(app)/players/[playerId]/page.tsx` — modify tab logic
- Frontend ContractCard: `apps/web/src/components/players/ContractCard.tsx` — add read-only mode
- No new routes needed — all changes are within existing player profile page

### Dependencies

- **Story 6.1** (MUST be completed first): Creates the contracts table, queries, mutations, actions, and ContractCard component that this story hardens.
- **Epic 2 (Story 2.1)**: Auth helpers (`requireAuth`, `requireRole`) and extended role enum must exist.
- **Epic 5 (Story 5.1)**: Player data model with `userId` linkage must exist for player-self checks.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6

### Debug Log References

- Backend tests: 495 tests passing across 22 files (including 30 new security tests)
- TypeScript: Clean compile for web app (0 errors)
- Convex codegen: Successfully regenerated with contracts module

### Completion Notes List

- **Story 6.1 dependency**: Since Story 6.1 (Contract Upload & AI Extraction) had not yet been implemented, this story created the contracts module infrastructure (table schema, queries, mutations) with security hardening baked in from the start. When Story 6.1 is implemented, it will extend these files with upload/extraction logic.
- **Contracts table**: Created `packages/backend/convex/table/contracts.ts` with teamId, playerId, fileId, extractionStatus, extractedData fields and proper indexes (by_playerId, by_teamId, by_teamId_playerId).
- **canViewContract query**: Implements AC7 — single source of truth for Contract tab visibility. Returns true only for admin or player-self, always scoped by teamId.
- **getContract query**: Returns null for unauthorized users (no error thrown per architecture pattern). Includes readOnly flag (true for player-self, false for admin).
- **getContractDownloadUrl query**: Same authorization logic as getContract — admin or player-self only.
- **Mutations**: Both uploadContract and updateContractFields use requireRole(ctx, ["admin"]) — non-admin users get NOT_AUTHORIZED ConvexError.
- **Frontend**: PlayerProfileTabs uses canViewContract prop (strict === true check) to completely omit Contract tab from DOM. ContractCard reads readOnly flag to conditionally show/hide edit/upload/replace buttons.
- **No tab flash**: canViewContract === true check ensures the tab isn't shown while the query is loading (undefined doesn't match true).
- **Test pattern**: Mutation guard tests use the capture-inside-run pattern from existing status-and-self-service.test.ts to properly extract ConvexError codes.
- **PlaceholderTab retained**: The PlaceholderTab component is still defined in PlayerProfileTabs.tsx but no longer used for the Contract tab (replaced by ContractCard). Keeping for potential future use by other tabs.
